# Day 27 - Week 7
## Pair Programming - Checkpoint Week
## What is a User Experience? What should be considered when developing a User Experience?
User experience is what the end user will experience when using the final application, website, or product you have programmed/developed. When considering the UX, you have consider simplicity and understandability of the features involved. Asking yourself, "Is this something everyone will find useful?" and "Is this feature necessary to the user and simple to understand?" are major questions required to making the User Experience a positive one.
## What are some benefits of taking into account the User Experience?
A couple of the benefits to taking into account the UX is that your users will want to use your product, will tell others to use your product, and will retain your end users.
## Why is the User Experience important?
It is important in a business context because it is highly valued that the end users will continue to use your product and your application/business can grow. We do not want to create something that is obsolete to the users and a waste of our time, energy, attention, and money.
