## Pair Programming - Checkpoint Week
## What is Pair Programming? What are the roles and how do they work?
Pair Programming is basically working with another developer on a singular project with a shared goal. Roles are defined by the group of individuals and can range from one person working on the FrontEnd and another on the BackEnd. You can have one person working on the CSS and another working on the data. Whichever you prefer!
## What are some benefits of Pair Programming?
Pair programming is beneficial due having fresh eyes on code and a partner (or partners) to help if you get stuck anywhere within your code.
## What are some drawbacks to Pair Programming?
One of the drawbacks to pair programming is communication and preferences to writing the code. Everyone has differences in their level of programming capabilities and communicating your programming knowledge can be difficult if you do not know your partner's level of knowledge and overall skill.
