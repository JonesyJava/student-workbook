## What is Code Documentation? What are some of the ways to document code?
Code documentation is anything you write in addition to your code to help someone else understand how it works. You can put notes into your code, wherever you see it necessary, or you can add a document file within your VS Code project file. This document file will allow anyone to reference if needed.
## What are some benefits of Code Documentation?
It helps you and your team to have reference abilities to your code so that it is easier for them to understand and pickup where ever necessary. It walso helps you to come back and know where you left off if you take time away from your code. 
## How important is Code documentation and why?
It is extremely helpful to teams based programming and legacy code. You should, as a professional programmer, be able to know exactly what is happening within the code, and be able to come back to code at any given time.
