# Day 4 - Week 1
## Wire-Framing, Design Tools, and Review
Today we started with an intro to Figma, which shows us how to visualize conceptual webpage designs. We then went over cloning sites again and reviewed what we learned a bit on day 3 in regards to bootstrap. I succesfully worked in a group of three to recreate a webpage called Den of Geeks, which we renamed Den of Comics (linked below).


## What is the purpose of wire-framing?
Wire-framing is important when trying to connect a site's information architecture to its visual design. This wire-framing shows the paths between pages. It also keeps information presented in consistent ways so the end-user finds the site more functional.

## What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?
There are three main types of wire-framing: low-fidelity wireframes, mid-fidelity wireframes, and high-fidelity wireframes. 
Low-fidelity wireframes are basic visual representations of the webpage and are useful as a design starting point. They do not have much detail and are used for mocking content and setting up a layout for your clients.
Mid-fidelity wireframes are the most commonly used wireframe. They detail more accurate representations of the layout, yet avoid distracting components such as images and typography.
High-fidelity wireframes are used to show-off pixel-specific layouts and are generally saved for latter stages of the design cycle. They are ideal for visualizing complex concepts such as menu systems and interactive features.

## Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?
I do believe all of these wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort. They allow you to stay on track of your development, as well as allow your clients to understand what it is they require in an end product.
