# Day 3 - Week 1
## Bootstrap Intro
Started Bootstrap today. We went over containers, rows, columns, and how to organize our webpages within a grid format. We also went through and recreated the cool-site page, but this time it was with bootstrap.

## What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?
My favorite tip I found beneficial was that you can add portions of your CSS within the class tag while utilizing bootstrap.

## Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.
Bootstrap resource: [https://getbootstrap.com/]
Font Awesome resource: [https://fontawesome.com/]
Bootswatch resource: [https://bootswatch.com/]
These are my favorite resources to use when looking for templates to make my page designs. 

## How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
I think a good design allows the users to engage more within the pages. You can convey the overall emphasis you are trying to obtain within your page. You can also make the site more easily navigatable for the end users, if you site is more appealing to the eye of the users.
