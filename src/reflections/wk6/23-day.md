# Day 23 - Week 6
## Intro to Vue.js - Router-View w/ Greg's List
Today we started the day with a Morning Challenge regarding a whiteboard problem with differences between two arrays. We then began learning again how to link API's and using router-view for injecting information. During the afternoon we were tasked with continuing what we learned towards recreating a previous project, "Greg's List". 
## What are lifecycle hooks? What are lifecycle hooks used for?
Lifestyle hooks are used to add information without reloading the page and/or injecting information by using template information. Some lifestyle hooks will also throw you an alert prompt, like unMounted, when using an input form. This will make sure the information you've applied is exactly what is requested upon moving forward into a new page.
## How have you utilized lifcycle hooks in your afternoon projects?
During the afternoon we utilized the onMounted lifestyle hook, which allows us to load a window of information without having to load a new page. 
## What are mounting hooks? When might you use them?
Mounting hooks are code that will run only after the entire view has been rendered.
