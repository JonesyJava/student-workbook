# Day 16 - Week 4
## Intro to Async Code and API's

## What does REST stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean?
REpresentational State Transfer. It means when a RESTful API is called, the server will transfer to the client a representation of the state of the requested resource.
## What does Stateless mean?
Stateless means the server does not remember anything about the user who uses the API.
## What URL pattern is used when writing a RESTful API?
The common HTTP methods are GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. These are the operations you want the server to perform on that specific resource.
