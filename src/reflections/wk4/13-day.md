# Day 13 - Week 4
## Intro to Async Code
Today we are being introduced to Asynchronous code which communicates with servers and API's. In class we created a Star Wars database with a Star Wars API. We also identified Async problems with code execution timing. From there we went into the Axios Service and writing/utilizing GET/POST/PUT/DELETE requests. 

## What are some of the signs and causes of Callback Hell?
If you have a function within a function within a funtion, this is a sure sign that you are in or heading into Callback Hell.
## What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?
Asynch code means that it does not read linearly within JS and it utilizes callbacks with the API. This means that the API has to fire and be responsive to the call that you place in order to render on your user page or DOM. You can set a timer as well which will let you know when or if the API has responded or not.
## Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix Callback Hell
Three ways to avoid or fix Callback Hell is to write comments within your code, split functions into smaller more coherent functions, as well as using promises within your code. The fourth way to deal with this potential issue is to use Async, which will allow you to never have to rely on consistantly writing functions that are nested one after another.
