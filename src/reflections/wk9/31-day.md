## Capstone Projects
## How are some ways Scrum for a small team would differ from Scrum with a large team?
Scrum with smaller teams have a bit more communication across all teams, which will differ from that of bigger teams because bigger teams will typically only have communication within a secular fashion. Although, there are some significant differences on velocity and efficiency within smaller and larger teams. Smaller teams will have a slower velocity, which is dependant on the overall task and size of the application being programmed. Depending on the size of the applications, lifecycles and sprints may also vary differently for smaller and larger teams.
## Why does Scrum prescribe to only run 1 sprint at a time.
This is predominantly to maintain an efficient velocity. We have to stay focused on the goal and what we are attempting to accomplish within development. A single sprint is the priority and making sure our features and software are working without errors is the main focus and why we are able to maintain velocity.
## What is the unattainable triangle and what purpose does it have in Scrum?
It’s the age old golden rule, you can either have it fast, cheap or good, but you can’t have it all. In marketing and advertising, this is referred to as the “unattainable triangle."

“The triangle is a maxim that high-quality goods delivered quickly and efficiently to customers will always come at a higher price and vice versa.” That is the cold, hard definition of the unattainable triangle.

The primary purpose Scrum has within the unnatainable triangle to make sure development teams are not sacrificing the quality of the product. Scrum also ensures that development teams are able to create a great product quickly and at the lowest cost to the business and customer.
