# Day 29 - Week 9
## Capstone Projects
## What technologies and principles are you using in your project?
In our project we are using Vue.js, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, SASS, Firebase, and MVC pattern framework. 
## What went well so far?
Our team was able to deligate tasks and communicate really well and we were able to assist and support eachother where ever necessary. I think our team was also great at planning for the project which also allowed use to reach our goals quickly without many, if at all, issues. 
## What would you do differently? Why?
I think the only thing I would have done differently is utilize an API. There weren't many API's that were great for our application and it was difficult to find an API that offered information for vehicles prior to 1996. This was the main limitation we kept finding and the specific reason we decided not to integrate an API during this time.
