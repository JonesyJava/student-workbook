# Day 11 - Week 3
## Intro to Javascript and MVC - Day 7
Today our class went more in depth with forms within MVC pattern. We began by creating a site called "Greg's List". This site showed us how to build and code a series of lists and functions that worked within our Controller, Services, AppState, and main javascript sections. We also learned how to better use Models and import our code by changing the inner HTML, as opposed to just creating new HTML every time.
## What are the two common operations that we will set in the handler?
Get and Set are the two common properties set within the handler.
## What do you have to make sure you are doing with every Get to insure the value does not become undefined?
Remember the Get operator takes in TWO parameters, the object itself AND the property being accessed. 
## What are some of the benefits of the proxy object that we are using in our structure for applications?
The benefits of the proxy objects we are using is that we are able to restrict manipulation to these objects and keep them private from the client users.
