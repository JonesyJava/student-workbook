# Day 9 - Week 3
## Intro to Javascript - Day 5
Today our class went started on MVC patterns, specifically Models. We are learning about classes and a more efficient way of using classed within JS. During our afternoon we went over creating classes with a challenge called "Alphabet Zoo", where we creat classes for a wide range of entities within a range from A to Z.

## What problem does using exports solve?
Exports allows you to utilize code from a different document. This solves a unique problem of organization and data types. Say you have a function that you want to use from a different JS document, you can export this function and utilize, or reuse it, within a different JS location by exporting and importing for continued use.
## How does export differ from export default?
Export allows you to reuse multiple peices of data, while export default only allows you to use a single peice of data to export. 
## What is a benefit of using the Module System?
The Module system is beneficial because this allows you to access bits of information from other locations and reuse the code within your code. It has a reuse purpose that is vital to efficiency and accessibility of important information.
