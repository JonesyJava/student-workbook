# Day 12 - Week 3
## Intro to Javascript and MVC - Day 8
We started the day going further into MVC pattern by creating a webpage called "PizzaShaq". In this webpage we wanted to create a pizza with individual/multiple toppings. Ultimately, we also were shown how to utilize local storage so that our pizza would save, even after the page was reloaded. 

## What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?
Oeserver patter allows for reusable code and has data bidning elements that give you a way to update parts of a page in response to certain events with data provided. 
## What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?
Subscribe, unsubscribe, and broadcast.
## Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.
The template gives public and specifically private abilities within data. With the proxy object only being accessible within the State, this not only gives you, the programmer, the control of your data, but limits the ability for end user clients to manipulate your code and data repository. While this is a great limitation to the accessibility of your code data, the observer patter then creates the resuability of the code and allows you to access the data whenever required. It's almost a symbiotic relationship within these two methods based on their ultimate purposes.
