## What is Software Development Testing?
Software Development Testing is the state in which software programs are tested for bugs within the code. While testing, the goal is to break the code or application so that programmers can ensure they have taken every precaution necessary towards making a solid program.
## What are the benefits of Testing in software development?
The benefits of testing your software is that you can make sure whatever it is you are attempting to deploy will not break when the end user is experiencing your application. Another benefit is knowing that noone will be able to hack into your data or information on the user side of the application. 
## What are some potential drawbacks of Testing in software development?
A potential drawback is relying on the testing to help fix your application. This said, it does take a lenghty amount of time having to find bugs within the code and then redploy to a development team to then fix the bugs. If there are more than a single cycle of this, then it can become a frustration and ultimately needs to be under control so that you can deploy a healthy application quickly with great code.
