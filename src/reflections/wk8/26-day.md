## Capstone Projects
## Why is communication on a small team important?
Communcation in a small team is vital to the overall health and efficiency of a team. When working in a small group, as well as a large group, communication must always be available and respectful. Communcation in solving problems, ask/providing advice, and making sure everyone on the team is participating and not getting steam rolled is also highly valuable for everyone to feel they are being utilized as a valuable asset towards the shared goal.
## What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?
Adjustments I believe are necessary is having meetings as frequently as the team feels it is necessary. In a smaller SCRUM team, this all comes down to being honest with your team and yourself, and ultimately communicating honestly to your team what you feel will allow your team to perform at peak efficiency. I also think their needs to be a Product Owner within the small team that designates themselves to keeping the team on track and not straying away from the shared goal and checkpoints determined.
## What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?
It’s the age old golden rule, you can either have it fast, cheap or good, but you can’t have it all. In marketing and advertising, this is referred to as the “unattainable triangle."

“The triangle is a maxim that high-quality goods delivered quickly and efficiently to customers will always come at a higher price and vice versa.” That is the cold, hard definition of the unattainable triangle.
