# Day 33 - Week 10
## C-Sharp Intro

## What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?
Int is an integer (whole number)
Char is a character commonly used within a VARCHAR form which sets a limitation to the character quantity
Bool is a boolean setting true and false

## What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?
Bool, Byte, Char, Decimal, Double, Enum, Float, Int are the value types. The biggest differences I have noticed from my experience with JS is that C# is very literal. C# is straight forward in its writing style and not very difficult to read back quickly. I've also noticed there is not a lot of leeway in the processing either. The code will either run or break. 

## In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?
The heap is where Reference types are stored which means there is a larger space for their use. Contrary to the heap, Value types are stored in the stack and are alloted a single space of memory.
