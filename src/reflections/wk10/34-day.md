## C-Sharp Intro

## What is a List in C#?
A list is an object which holds variables in a specific order. The type of variable that the list can store is defined using the generic syntax.

## What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?
Usig Find, Add, Sort, Remove list methods are, in my opinion, the most commonly used methods. This is because they contribute to the CRUD method. 

## How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?
To retireve an item from a list the best method would be to use Find or FindAll and Sort combined to sift through your array.
