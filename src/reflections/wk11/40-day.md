# Day 40 - Week 11
## C-Sharp Week 2

### Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your final project, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

Overall, I've had a great experience within the course Codeworks provides. The experience and education was one of the best steps I could have taken in improving my life and my future, not only within a career standpoint but in an overall personal development point as well. I've met so many new people that I respect and know will continue to be with me in the years to come. I've also met some of my best friends here at Codeworks and for this I'm extremely thankful.

I don't have many, if any, concerns regarding my experience at Codeworks.

As far as following my graduation and completion of the course, I will continue to code 7 days a week. Skipping a day of coding once a week is 52 missed opportunities throught the year to become a better software developer. Coding is just like any sport and so few are willing to give the effort, dedication, and consistency necessary to being great at what they do. This is the mentality I've been so fortunate to have had instilled by my family and will continue to move forward with my newly aqcuired skillset in this fashion.
