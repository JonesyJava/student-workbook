## What is SQL injection?
SQL injection, also known as SQLI, is a common attack vector that uses malicious SQL code for backend database manipulation to access information that was not intended to be displayed. This information may include any number of items, including sensitive company data, user lists or private customer details.
## What are 3 methods SQL injection can be done by?
Types of SQL Injections:
-- In-band SQLi. The attacker uses the same channel of communication to launch their attacks and to gather their results. ...
-- Inferential (Blind) SQLi. The attacker sends data payloads to the server and observes the response and behavior of the server to learn more about its structure. ...
-- Out-of-band SQLi.
## How can we detect and sanitize SQL injection attacks?
