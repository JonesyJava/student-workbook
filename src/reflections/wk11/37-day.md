## What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#?
Inheritance allows for classes to inherit attributes given to a parent class, which will then be allowed to aquire said attributes from this parent base class.
## How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class?
Member inheritance is created with a base class which then, when called upon in another class, is passed along and aquired by this new class. A class can only inherit members that are written to be inherited within a public designation. 
## How does accessibility affect inheritance?
Inheritance can only be accessed once within each class. Interface, however, can be accessed as many times as needed after set within the interface base.
