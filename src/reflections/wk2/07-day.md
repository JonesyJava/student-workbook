# Day 7 - Week 2
## Intro to Javascript - Day 3
Today our class went over "Crazy Cat Lady", which was a tutorial similar to our prerequisite project "Moody Kittens". We went over onclick as a function and utilizing id's. We then went over how to call id's within our JS code and the clean professional ways of laying out our function codes. We then went over a previous question from yesterdays practice questions and how to complete it thoroughly. 

## What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.
Console.log is a great way to write things on the console. This allows you to test your code to see what is responding and what might not be responding. Another way to use your console is to read errors and printed messages. This will overall allow you to clean up your code if needed and test functions in the process.You can also evaluate conditional statements.   

## Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?
The Elements tab allos you to see the breakdown of your HTML and CSS. This is a great way to make any adjustments without interfering with your actual code because it does not save or have the ability to be saved.

## Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?
A great way to debug your code is to apply the 'debugger' within your code and then run it. This will show you what is happening when the computer reads your lines and what you may want to adjust or fix.
