# Day 8 - Week 2
## Intro to Javascript - Day 4
Today our class went into more depth on JS and we were assigned a group project called "The Slap Game". Me and my partner made a game called "Jigglypuff Power Punch" that demonstrated our understanding of javascript within a simple game. I'm still struggling a bit with the concepts of JS but everyday I'm improving and getting a better understanding of functions and the different types functions used in different situations. 

## What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?
The main benefit of planning before starting to code is that you understand what you are going to specifically need and do within your code. It allows you to compartmentalize your overall task and allow for a successful end product with fewer hiccups. 

## How do you find answers when you are stuck?
When I'm stuck somewhere in my code, I Google. From there I try to find similar issues that others may have had or maybe a video on Youtube that miight help. I also heavily use W3Schools and Stack Overflow for specific issues I might be having with HTML, CSS, or JS. 
## From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?
Planning too much might be detrimental. When they say that too much water might poison you, I've felt that during coding after I planned too much and needed to look back and just simplify my scope. Moving forward, I plan on making notes prior to coding new features so my code can will be clean.
