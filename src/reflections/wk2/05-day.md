# Day 5 - Week 2
## Intro to Javascript
Today we went over an intro to JavaScript. We convered functions, switches, and objects, among other aspects within JavaScript functions. During the afternoon, we had an exercise where we went over some test situations within conditionals, numbers, strings, objects, and switches. I struggled in the beginning trying to set up and write functions on my own. However, left the day feeling really confident in my ability to create functions and manipulate the data!
