# Day 5 - Week 2
## Intro to Javascript
Today we went over an intro to JavaScript. We convered functions, switches, and objects, among other aspects within JavaScript functions. During the afternoon, we had an exercise where we went over some test situations within conditionals, numbers, strings, objects, and switches. I struggled in the beginning trying to set up and write functions on my own. However, left the day feeling really confident in my ability to create functions and manipulate the data! 

## What is Scope ?
Scope is where the variables are available for use. 

## What is Hoisting ?
Hoisting is a JS mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before the code execution.

## In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?
LET is preferred for variable declaration now, unlike VAR. LET is also a blocked scope. It is used only within the block {} of code.

CONST is used to declare variables and maintain a constant value. CONST is also a blocked scope and can not be updated or re-declared.

VAR declarations are globally scoped unlike LET and CONST. VAR variables can be updated and re-declared whithin it's scope. VAR variables are also initialized with 'undefined'.
