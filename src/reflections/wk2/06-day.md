# Day 6 - Week 2
## Intro to Javascript - Day 2
Today our class went over for loops, array methods, and functions again. I'm starting to get more comfortable with for loops and arrays. This afternoon we went over more practice situations with array methods, for loops, and functions. 

## What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

## What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

## What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?
